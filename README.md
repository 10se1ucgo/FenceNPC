# Fence NPC

Fence NPC is an NPC addon for DarkRP that allows players, more specifically thieves, to sell items they have stolen from other users in a raid. It's very useful for players who worry about the possibility of the original owner logging off the server, making most of their items simply disappear. It's also great for items that have value only to their original owner. The thief will still have an incentive to go out and raid, even if the items of the victim's has no value to the thief, because he can still sell it in the end to the NPC. It's a wonderful addition to a DarkRP server and increases the amount of roleplay.

It's super easy to configure and many things can be effortlessly customized.
